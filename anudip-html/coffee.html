<h3 id="Roasting">Roasting</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">
    Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions, such as infusions from green
    coffee beans, coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or
    it can be home roasted. The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing
    the coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost
    and increases in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also
    influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging.
<br><br>
The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside the bean reaches approximately 200 °C
(392 °F), though different varieties of seeds differ in moisture and density and therefore roast
at different rates. During roasting, caramelization occurs as intense heat breaks down starches,
changing them to simple sugars that begin to brown, which alters the color of the bean.</p>
<h3 id="Storage">Storage</h3>
<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:14pt">
    Coffee is best stored in an airtight container made of ceramic, glass or non-reactive
    metal.Higher quality prepackaged coffee usually has a one-way valve which prevents air from
    entering while allowing the coffee to release gases.Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved
    when it is stored away from moisture, heat, and light. <br>
    The ability of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means that it should be kept away from
    such smells. Storage of coffee in refrigerators is not recommended due to the presence of
    moisture which can cause deterioration. Exterior walls of buildings which face the sun may heat
    the interior of a home, and this heat may damage coffee stored near such a wall. Heat from
    nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.</p>
