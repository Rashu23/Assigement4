    <p style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: antiquewhite;" >Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions, such as infusions from green
    coffee beans, coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or
    it can be home roasted. The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing
    the coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost
    and increases in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also
    influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging.</p><hr><br>
